##Developped with :

*[three.js](https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js): a 3D javascript library under MIT license
*[threejs-cgs](https://github.com/looeee/threejs-csg): a Constructive Solid Geometry tool for three.js under MIT license 

##To do:

*A simple GUI to make the ring parametric.
*Improve rendering quality so that it looks more like gold or silver.

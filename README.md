## Usage:

This project is a model of a ring that can be downloaded in STL format for 3D printing.
https://francoisfarnault.github.io/hyperboloid-ring/

## Developed with :

* [three.js](https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js): a 3D javascript library under MIT license
* [threejs-cgs](https://github.com/looeee/threejs-csg): a Constructive Solid Geometry tool for three.js under MIT license 

## To do:

* Try Dat GUI to see if it improves code readability.
* Limit the thickness so that an uncomfortable ring can not be printed.
* Improve rendering quality so that it looks more like gold or silver.
* Fine tune the mesh generation.
* Design a bangle version.
